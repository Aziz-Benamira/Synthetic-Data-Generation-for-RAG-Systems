    "## Section 2: Understanding A2A Protocol Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we code, let's understand what we're building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is A2A?\n",
    "**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** is a communication protocol that lets AI agents talk to each other, regardless of:\n",
    "- What programming language they're written in\n",
    "- What framework they use (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)\n",
    "- Who built them\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like HTTP for websites - it's a standard way for agents to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Agent** \n",
    "An AI system that can:\n",
    "- Receive messages\n",
    "- Process them (maybe using an LLM)\n",
    "- Send back responses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Agent Card**\n",
    "Like a business card for your agent. It tells others:\n",
    "- Who you are (name, description)\n",
    "- Where to reach you (URL)\n",
    "- What you can do (skills)\n",
    "- How to authenticate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Message**\n",
    "A single communication between agents:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User/Agent → \"What's the weather?\" → Your Agent\n",
    "Your Agent → \"It's sunny, 72°F\" → User/Agent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Task**\n",
    "A unit of work. For long-running operations:\n",
    "- Has a unique ID\n",
    "- Tracks state (submitted → working → completed)\n",
    "- Can have artifacts (results)\n",
    "- Supports multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Part**\n",
    "A piece of content in a message:\n",
    "- Text: `\"Hello world\"`\n",
    "- Files: PDFs, images, etc.\n",
    "- Data: JSON objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication Flow\n",
