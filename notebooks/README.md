# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and prototyping.

## Organization

- `00_exploration/` - Initial data exploration
- `01_prototypes/` - Prototype implementations
- `02_analysis/` - Results analysis and visualization
- `03_experiments/` - Experimental runs and comparisons

## Naming Convention

```
{number}_{short_description}.ipynb
```

Example: `01_question_generation_prototype.ipynb`

## Best Practices

1. Clear markdown cells explaining each step
2. Include visualizations where helpful
3. Save outputs for reproducibility
4. Keep notebooks focused on a single topic
5. Clean up before committing (clear outputs if sensitive)
